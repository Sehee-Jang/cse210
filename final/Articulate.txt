Programming with Classes - Articulate

Overview
    Articulate the principles of programming with classes.

Instructions
    You have now learned about each of four principles of Programming with Classes:

    Abstraction
    Encapsulation
    Inheritance
    Polymorphism

You have also used these principles to design and develop your final project. This final project is the Foundation 4 project and includes all four of those programs, so you can refer to any of the code you used in those programs.

As a final Articulate assignment, return to Canvas and answer the following questions (the way you would in a job interview):
    - Briefly define each of the 4 principles of Programming with Classes.
    - For each principle: Describe how each principle was used in your final project.
    - Overall: How did using these principles help your final project become more flexible for future changes? (Provide specific examples.)

Your response must:
    Explain the meaning of each principle.
    Highlight how each principle was used in your final project.
    Explain how these principles make your final project more flexible for changes.
    Thoroughly explain these concepts (this likely cannot be done in less than 100 words)

Abstraction
1. Abstraction means only essential features of an object are remained while hiding the unnecessary details.
2. Use in project:
